# Contains information about this schema file

  # Version of schema file, should match end of file name
  # Incremented every merged schema change
  version: 5

# Each decompressed variable name corresponds to a length 2 or 3 list
# First item is the compressed variable name
# Second item is server-side data type
# Third item (if it exists) is the type within the list
# Names starting with "_" do not correspond to a compressed variable, they are used to aid in (de)compression
