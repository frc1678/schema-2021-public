# Used for Match Collection QR compression by Match Collection App and QR decompression by Server
# QR is encoded in an Alphanumeric QR

# Contains information about this schema file
schema_file:
  # Version of schema file, should match end of file name
  # Incremented every merged schema change
  version: 8

# Each decompressed variable name corresponds to a length 2 or 3 list
# First item is the compressed variable name
# Second item is server-side data type
# Third item (if it exists) is the type within the list
# Names starting with "_" do not correspond to a compressed variable, they are used to aid in (de)compression

# Data that is shared between the objective and subjective QRs. 
generic_data:
  _separator: '$' # Separates key:value pairs
  _section_separator: '%' # Separates generic from objective/subjective data
  schema_version: [A, int] # Must remain constant between versions
  serial_number: [B, str]
  scout_name: [C, str]
  match_number: [D, int]
  timestamp: [E, int]

# Data specific to objective match collection QR
objective_tim:
  _start_character: '+' # First character in QR used to identify QR type
  _separator: '$' # Separates key:value pairs
  team_number: [Z, str] # Mostly used as a str, not needed as int
  timeline: [V, list, dict] # List of dictionaries

# Timeline is part of objective match collection QR
# Data for an action in the timeline
# First value represents the length, second represents the target type
timeline:
  # No separators within timeline to reduce QR size. Each action is a fixed 5-character length
  time: [3, int] # Encoded in base 10. Always length 3, eg '051' for 51 seconds
  action_type: [2, Enum] # Encoded in base 36. Always length 2 eg '0a' for the 10th action

# Data specific to subjective match collection QR
subjective_aim:
  _start_character: '*' # First character in QR used to identify QR type
  _separator: '$' # Separates each key:value pair
  _separator_internal: ':' # Separates each ranking list item
  speed_rankings: [A, list, str] # List of team numbers (strings)
  agility_rankings: [B, list, str] # List of team numbers (strings)


# Contains all the enums and their values
# Action type is a string representation of a base 36 integer
